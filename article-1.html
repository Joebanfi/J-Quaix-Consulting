        <p><strong>Under the hood of American retail – October 2020</strong></p>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Even before Covid-19 swept across the world – shutting down economies
        and non-essential businesses worldwide – immense structural change was
        underway in American retail. Many of the industry’s oldest and biggest
        names were battling for their lives. Others had passed the point of no
        return.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Pictures are often worth a thousand words and stock prices certainly
        paint a bleak picture.
      </p>
      <img src="./img/imageone.jpg" />
      <p>
        Much has been written about the death of the mall and American retail.
        Individual circumstances matter, of course, but one trend nonetheless
        emerges: widespread declining market capitalization.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Stock prices are largely based on profits and profits have declined
        consistently. This is not a well-kept secret. The factors behind
        deteriorating profits, however, are less understood and more surprising.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        This report will attempt to unpick them and shed light on wider industry
        dynamics. Understanding both offers a glimpse into what retail landscape
        is likely to emerge once the dust settles on these tumultuous times.
      </p>
      <h3><p><b>Methodology</b></p></h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        This report looked at data from US publicly-listed consumer goods
        retailers (non-food) with more than $1bn in sales, between 2015-19. It
        covered 30 retailers responsible for a combined $340bn of annual
        turnover and 41,000 stores, representing categories from department
        stores, apparel, footwear, sporting goods, home décor & furniture,
        beauty, jewelry, and clearance.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>The dataset did not include:</p>
      <ul class="indent">
        <li>
          Supermarkets and gas stations – who mostly sell non-discretionary
          fuel and food items
        </li>
        <li>
          Home improvement stores – whose fate is largely tied to the
          construction industry
        </li>
        <li>
          Ecommerce pure-players – whose business models are not the subject
          of this report
        </li>
        <li>
          Categories with just one retailer in the dataset <sup><small>(1)</small></sup>, where the risk
          of confusing category performance for the individual retailer’s, and
          vice versa, was great
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><p><b>Behind the numbers</b></p></h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        The bottom line – and there was increasingly less of one for retailers –
        is that this is a watershed period in retail. Two-thirds of the
        retailers in this report had a smaller market capitalization in 2020
        than 2016 <sup><small>(2)</small></sup>, despite the S&P500 going +65% over that period. Excluding
        discounters (TJX, Burlington and Ross Stores), the combined market
        capitalization of retailers under study fell -19%, wiping out almost
        $34bn of market value.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        There are many legitimate rationales for investors wanting to take their
        money out of legacy retail:
      </p>
      <ul class="indent">
        <li>
          The inexorable rise of Amazon and belief it will gobble up entire
          retail categories
        </li>
        <li>
          The emergence of discounters, and traditional retail responding via
          increased discounting
        </li>
        <li>
          The steady growth of manufacturing costs – especially in Asia – and
          absence of consumer price inflation at home to offset impacts on gross
          margins
        </li>
        <li>
          The idea that there are far more physical stores around the country
          than are required, and that downsizing will be a slow and bloody
          process
        </li>
        <li>
          The belief that traditional players are incapable of transforming to
          an online, multi-channel world - or will do so too slowly and clumsily
        </li>
        <li>
          That by trying to be everything to everyone, many legacy retailers
          no longer provide an attractive consumer proposition.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Fundamentally, however, market prices reflect one reality: future
        expected profits. Past performance remains the best available indicator
        of future performance and net income data <sup><small>(3)</small></sup> from recent years is clear
        and conclusive.
      </p>
      <h3><p><b>Follow the profit</b></p></h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        The combined net incomes of retailers in our dataset fell -18% between
        2015-19, from $15.2bn to $12.4bn. Excluding discount channels, whose
        results were stellar, profits collapsed -41%. As a percentage of sales,
        that took them from an already timid average of 5.0% to just 3.7% - or
        1.9% excluding discounters.<sup><small>(4)</small></sup>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Other developed markets showed a similar trend, as did grocery
        retailing.
      </p>
      <img src="./img/imagetwo.jpg" />
      <img src="./img/imagethree.jpg" />
      <p>
        The relation between profit change and market capitalization at a
        company-level was strong, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of
        r=0.855 (0 being no relation and 1 perfect correlation).<small>(5)</small>
      </p>
      <img src="./img/imagefour.jpg" />
      <p>
        Financial markets had every cause to be concerned, and they reacted
        accordingly.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        What caused the decline in profits, however, is misunderstood.
        Simplistically speaking, profits are determined by (1) sales i.e.
        revenues, (2) gross margins, and (3) operating expenses i.e. rent,
        people, capital investments etc, and the relation between the three.
      </p>
      <h4><p><b>1. The sales theory</b></p></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        The most common theory is that traditional retailers are worth less
        because they are losing sales – dubbed the “Amazon theory”. In a world
        where dollars are leaving brick-and-mortar for online, traditional
        retailers recapture only part of the dollars on their own websites and
        their total revenues decline. That quickly impacts profits, as costs are
        mostly not adjustable.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        With two-thirds of the retailers in the dataset shedding both profit and
        market value, one would expect sales levels to have declined too. In
        fact, that was far from the case.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Out of 30 retailers, only 7 saw sales decline. Combined sales grew +10%,
        including +6% without discounters. 2019 was a record year of sales for
        Target, Foot Locker, Dick’s, REI, Genesco, Designer Brands (DSW) and
        American Eagle – although half were worth less in 2020 than 2016. Just
        one retailer saw sales decline in the double-digits: JC Penney (-15%).
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Indeed, although ecommerce captured 40% of total retail growth in the US
        since 2016<sup><small>(6)</small></sup>, part of that growth went to traditional retailers (via
        their websites), and that still left another 60% for brick-and-mortar.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The fact that market capitalization (ex. Discounters) fell -19% while
        sales grew suggests limited linearity between the two. Examples abound
        where they moved in polar opposite directions. Hibbett Sports, for
        instance, grew revenues +26% but lost -51% of its market value. DSW grew
        +33% but lost -49% of its value. Urban Outfitters (URBN) grew sales +16%
        but lost -18% of its value. Sales and profit, too, show few signs of
        moving hand in hand.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        That is not to say sales growth was irrelevant. It seemed to be a
        pre-requisite for market cap growth – no retailer grew the latter
        without the former, and it usually took high sales growth to lift stock
        prices.<sup><small>(7)</small></sup>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Sales in isolation, however, do not explain underlying trends in the
        retail industry.
      </p>
      <h4><p><b>2. The Gross Margin theory</b></p></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        The second major contributor to profit is gross margins. Gross margins
        depend both on real retail prices i.e. the price of goods at checkout,
        and on the cost of acquiring those goods (COGS). Cost of goods often
        represent more than two-thirds of retailers’ sales, so their role is
        critical.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Many legacy retailers, the theory goes, have had to resort to mass
        discounting and promotions to retain customers, hurting real retail
        prices and margins. Simultaneously, consumer goods are still largely
        manufactured overseas – particularly in the Far East – where costs have
        risen fast. Consumer-price inflation at home, meanwhile, has remained
        low.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
       <i>Rising input costs + widespread discounting + a lack of consumer-price
        inflation = a recipe for declining gross margins</i>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Yet here too, the data is not convincing. Cost of goods did increase
        over the period, but at +11.6% growth they did not do so much faster
        than sales (+10.2%). As a share of sales, they inched up from 65.8% to
        66.6%.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Although manufacturing costs in Asia have increased, retailers and
        brands have also moved production around. Apparel manufacturing moved to
        India and Bangladesh and footwear to Indonesia or Vietnam. Furniture and
        home goods adjusted, too, and beauty products are still largely
        manufactured in the US or Europe, so relatively unaffected.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Retailers were also able, perhaps, to pass on rising input costs to
        their suppliers and brands. Either way, gross margin trends are not
        sufficient to explain declining profits.
      </p>
      <h4><p><b>3. Operating expenses</b></p></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        That leaves operating expenses – the day-to-day costs required to run a
        retail business, the biggest of which are usually rent, people and
        capital investments. (For highly leveraged retailers, debt servicing can
        be too). Whereas cost of goods represent two-thirds of sales, operating
        expenses – poorly managed – can rise to a third.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Financial data shows total retail operating costs grew +17.2% between
        2015-19, comfortably outpacing sales. That saw them rise from 25.2% of
        sales to 26.8%. That may not sound like much, but combined with slightly
        higher COGS, the 1.6 percentage point increase in operating costs was
        enough to wipe out all profit growth over the period, and more.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Looked at another way, had operating expenses remained constant at 25.2%
        of sales, profits in 2019 would have been $5.5bn higher than 2015, a
        +18% increase rather than the actual -18% decline. The health of retail,
        today, would be judged very differently.
      </p>
      <img src="./img/imagefive.jpg" />
      <h3><p><b>Balancing today versus tomorrow</b></p></h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Outside of earnings calls and analyst reports, operating expenses are
        rarely mentioned in conversations on the state of retail. Yet they will
        likely shape its future.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Operating costs are usually combined into one reporting line called
        “selling & general administrative expenses”, so financial reports offer
        an incomplete picture. Nevertheless, several factors likely explain
        their upward trajectory.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        First, people and rents were probably not the cause. US wage growth
        barely averaged 1.5% a year between 2014-18.<sup><small>(8)</small></sup> The lowest incomes,
        which most retail workers sadly are, grew even less. Additionally, there
        were only 0.6% more workers employed in retail in 2019 than 4 years
        earlier.<sup><small>(9)</small></sup> That does not point to increased people costs. If anything,
        they probably fell as a share of sales as retailers reduced the number
        of salespeople on the shop floor.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Rents, too, were unlikely a contributing factor. Commercial leases have
        barely kept up with inflation. Vacancies are widespread. Retailers are
        closing under-performing stores. Even if sales densities (per square
        foot) have tended to fall, online sales more than make up. The drivers
        of increased operating costs are to be found elsewhere in the business.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The reality is that retailers have taken stock of the critical juncture at which they
        stand and started investing heavily for the future – a last
        throw of the dice of sorts. That includes investing in everything from
        overhauling IT systems, omnichannel and digital capability, refitting
        warehouses for ecommerce, and experimenting with alternative business
        models.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Increased IT spending in retail is widespread. Cloud sales are booming. “Digital transformations” are the bread and butter of management consulting firms – as much as 88% of retailers claim to be undertaking one.<sup><small>(10)</small></sup> IT investments touch everything from people processes to inventory management and shipping. Dynamic inventory management, ship from store, buy online and pick-up in person – all have stretched retailer’s legacy systems and triggered investments. In addition, for all the talk of AI reshaping entire sectors of the economy, no industry is poised to benefit more than retail (McKinsey)<sup><small>(11)</small></sup>. All of these investments are imperative, but few are inexpensive.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Traditional retailers are also experimenting with alternative business
        models. Nordstrom acquired subscription service Trunk Club for $350m in
        2016 (equivalent to their entire profit that year); Foot Locker invested
        $100m in sneaker-reselling app GOAT last year (20% of profits); rental
        services and second-hand resale platforms are proliferating. Not all
        will pay off, but attempts are being made.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Lastly, capital expenditures are being driven by brick-and-mortar
        itself, through renovation and innovation. New flagships and concept
        stores are opening regularly. Nordstrom opened its first New York City
        flagship last year. Foot Locker, Kohl’s, Dick’s, Crate & Barrel all
        recently unveiled new concept store formats. DSW has installed nail
        salons in many stores. Nearly every major retailer is experimenting,
        looking for the store of the future, and embracing the new “retail as
        theatre” mantra.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        These are just a few of the extensive, expensive and belated investments
        retailers are making. Short-term profits, then, were sacrificed in favor
        of a better shot at long-term survival.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The current share of sales generated online is probably a good indicator
        of who the future winners and losers are likely to be. Sadly, that
        metric is rarely disclosed (in itself a telling sign). Some retailers
        will successfully reinvent themselves and emerge as new, future-ready
        entities. Many will not be so fortunate. The stock market has continued
        to value retailers largely on their reported profits. It may yet have to
        refine its criteria.
      </p>
      <h3><p><b>Not all retailers were created equal</b></p></h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Amid all this, it is easy to forget significant variance exists within
        brick-and-mortar retail. Performances were uneven. Ulta Beauty and its
        +89% sales growth was in few ways alike to Kohl’s, despite the two often
        standing side by side in strip malls.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        In this context, it is worth examining several other theories on the
        decline of brick-and-mortar:
      </p>
      <ul class="indent">
      <li> Stores are too big and big-box models outdated </li>
      <li> Retailers have too many stores </li>
      <li> Retailers sell too many different categories </li>
      </ul>
      <h4><p><b>1. Size of stores</b></p></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        Our dataset shows no clear relation between a retailer’s performance and
        the size of their stores.<sup><small>(12)</small></sup> Some retailers performed well despite
        operating big-box formats, including Restauration Hardware and Dicks,
        who grew sales +26% and +20% respectively. Discount retailers, too,
        outperformed despite operating relatively large stores. Home Depot and
        Lowe’s are further illustration that large stores can work.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Size does not seem to matter.</p>
      <h4><p><b>2. Too many stores</b></p></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        A second argument suggests retailers are stretched across too many
        locations, with too many in unprofitable markets. That, too, does not
        stand up to scrutiny. There is no apparent (negative) correlation
        between number of stores and sales or profit growth.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Besides retailers like TJX and Ross, who have some of the widest store
        bases in the country, Ulta Beauty and Target both show a retailer can
        have 1,800+ stores in the US and still thrive. As retail executives
        attest, some of the smallest markets are sometimes home to the most
        profitable stores.
      </p>
      <img src="./img/imagesix.jpg" />
      <h4><p><b>3. Jack of all trades, master of none</b></p></h4>
      <br>
      <p>This argument is perhaps the most compelling.</p>
      <p>
        The consumer goods in this report were broken down into 15
        sub-categories:
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        1. Leather goods & watches 2. Casual & formal apparel 3. Athletic
        apparel 4. Casual & formal footwear 5. Athletic footwear 6. Kids apparel
        & footwear 7. Sporting goods 8. Beauty 9. Bed & bath 10. Furniture 11.
        Jewelry 12. Toys & baby product 13. Electronics 14. Hardware 15. Pet
        supplies
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Tallying the number offered by each retailer in their stores <sup><small>(13)</small></sup> shows
        it to be one of the most accurate predictors of a retailer’s sales
        performance: the more categories, the less retailers were able to
        generate growth.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Retailers that sold 4 or fewer categories (two-thirds of surveyed
        retailers) grew sales +27% and kept profits flat. Those that sold 5+
        categories failed to grow sales at all and saw profits collapse -34%.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        16 retailers grew sales double digits – only Urban Outfitters managed to
        do so with more than 4 categories (+18% sales with 8 categories)<sup><small>(14)</small></sup>.
        Conversely, 5 of the 7 retailers who saw sales decline offered more than
        6 categories in stores.
      </p>
      <img src="./img/imageseven.jpg" />
      <p> Department stores – who tend to offer between 10 and 14 categories – were among the worst performers. Their lack of focus has seen them become over-inventoried, over-categorized and increasingly unable to attract customers.</p>
      <br>
      <p> The relation holds whether or not discounters and department stores are included.<sup><small>(15)</small></sup> Where one-stop-shops were once prized by consumers for their convenience, in a world where infinite choice exists online, brick-and-mortar must offer something different to customers. At that game, the specialists have shown to be more adept.</p>
      <img src="./img/imageeight.jpg" />
      <p><b>Into the future </b></p>
      <p>
        Beneath all the data, trends from the last few years offer a glimpse
        into the future.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The retailers most likely to make the transition to Retail 2.0 will be
        neither big nor small. Stores will continue to come in all sizes. For
        every small, urban store, there will be a successful big-box chain. Some
        retailers will continue to thrive with 2,000+ stores nationwide. Others
        will find success only in razor-like focus on 120 key markets.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Brick-and-mortar retailers, however, will have to become not just
        proficient omni-channel operators, but also more specialized, focusing
        on a narrow assortment of product and building compelling experiences
        around them. The generalist one-stop-shop role will be left to
        ecommerce.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Where that leaves department stores remains to be seen, but the writings
        on the wall are not reassuring.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Lastly, discounters have emerged as formidable retailers, built on a
        narrow strategy of selling cheap branded wares from previous seasons.
        That they rely on the stock mismanagement of others to acquire product
        is unlikely to become a liability anytime soon. Their lack of digital
        capability, however, may. Only time will tell if they deserve their
        newly lofty valuations.
      </p>
      <h3><p><b>Final thoughts</b></p></h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Industries generally respond to structural shocks by consolidating. That
        happens in two ways – through mergers or acquisitions, or when weaker
        players disappear.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        There have been shy signs of retail M&A in the US, mostly among smaller
        chains: Hibbett & City Gear, DTLR & Villa, JD Sports & Finish Line,
        Snipes & Kicks USA, Mr. Alan’s, among others. Authentic Brands with its
        Aeropostale, Forever 21 and Lucky Brand acquisitions is one large player
        experimenting. Rising capital expenditures will continue to make
        consolidation appealing. Still, M&A activity has been underwhelming
        relative to the shock facing the industry – the unwanted baggage of
        acquiring a competitor’s stores leases weighs heavily on the process.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        That leaves the bankruptcy route. The 2020 pandemic accelerated many
        casualties, most recently JC Penney and Neiman Marcus. The data suggests
        more are on the way.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
In the long run, however, retailers that successfully innovate, invest, embed technology and transition to the new retail age stand to gain everything. According to research, automation and superior customer experiences are projected to help the store of the future become twice as profitable as it is today.<sup><small>(16)</small></sup> That would put the retail industry back on its pedestal of yesteryear. Some legacy retailers may yet be worth doubling down on.

      <h1><strong>Decrypting the Retail Apocalypse</strong></h1>
      <img src="./img/imagezero.jpg" />
      <h2>
        <p><strong>Under the hood of American retail – October 2020</strong></p>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Even before Covid-19 swept across the world – shutting down economies
        and non-essential businesses worldwide – immense structural change was
        underway in American retail. Many of the industry’s oldest and biggest
        names were battling for their lives. Others had passed the point of no
        return.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pictures are often worth a thousand words and stock prices certainly
        paint a bleak picture.
      </p>
      <img src="./img/imageone.jpg" />
      <p>
        Much has been written about the death of the mall and American retail.
        Individual circumstances matter, of course, but one trend nonetheless
        emerges: widespread declining market capitalization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stock prices are largely based on profits and profits have declined
        consistently. This is not a well-kept secret. The factors behind
        deteriorating profits, however, are less understood and more surprising.
      </p>
      <p>
        This report will attempt to unpick them and shed light on wider industry
        dynamics. Understanding both offers a glimpse into what retail landscape
        is likely to emerge once the dust settles on these tumultuous times.
      </p>
      <p><b>Methodology</b></p>
      <p>
        This report looked at data from US publicly-listed consumer goods
        retailers (non-food) with more than $1bn in sales, between 2015-19. It
        covered 30 retailers responsible for a combined $340bn of annual
        turnover and 41,000 stores, representing categories from department
        stores, apparel, footwear, sporting goods, home décor & furniture,
        beauty, jewelry, and clearance.
      </p>
      <p>The dataset did not include:</p>
      <ul class="indent">
        <li>
          - Supermarkets and gas stations – who mostly sell non-discretionary
          fuel and food items
        </li>
        <li>
          - Home improvement stores – whose fate is largely tied to the
          construction industry
        </li>
        <li>
          - Ecommerce pure-players – whose business models are not the subject
          of this report
        </li>
        <li>
          - Categories with just one retailer in the dataset(1), where the risk
          of confusing category performance for the individual retailer’s, and
          vice versa, was great
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Behind the numbers</b></p>
      <p>
        The bottom line – and there was increasingly less of one for retailers –
        is that this is a watershed period in retail. Two-thirds of the
        retailers in this report had a smaller market capitalization in 2020
        than 2016(2), despite the S&P500 going +65% over that period. Excluding
        discounters (TJX, Burlington and Ross Stores), the combined market
        capitalization of retailers under study fell -19%, wiping out almost
        $34bn of market value.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many legitimate rationales for investors wanting to take their
        money out of legacy retail:
      </p>
      <ul class="indent">
        <li>
          - The inexorable rise of Amazon and belief it will gobble up entire
          retail categories
        </li>
        <li>
          - The emergence of discounters, and traditional retail responding via
          increased discounting
        </li>
        <li>
          - The steady growth of manufacturing costs – especially in Asia – and
          absence of consumer price inflation at home to offset impacts on gross
          margins
        </li>
        <li>
          - The idea that there are far more physical stores around the country
          than are required, and that downsizing will be a slow and bloody
          process
        </li>
        <li>
          - The belief that traditional players are incapable of transforming to
          an online, multi-channel world - or will do so too slowly and clumsily
        </li>
        <li>
          - That by trying to be everything to everyone, many legacy retailers
          no longer provide an attractive consumer proposition.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Fundamentally, however, market prices reflect one reality: future
        expected profits. Past performance remains the best available indicator
        of future performance and net income data(3) from recent years is clear
        and conclusive.
      </p>
      <p><b>Follow the profit</b></p>
      <p>
        The combined net incomes of retailers in our dataset fell -18% between
        2015-19, from $15.2bn to $12.4bn. Excluding discount channels, whose
        results were stellar, profits collapsed -41%. As a percentage of sales,
        that took them from an already timid average of 5.0% to just 3.7% - or
        1.9% excluding discounters.(4)
      </p>
      <p>
        Other developed markets showed a similar trend, as did grocery
        retailing.
      </p>
      <img src="./img/imagetwo.jpg" />
      <img src="./img/imagethree.jpg" />
      <p>
        The relation between profit change and market capitalization at a
        company-level was strong, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of
        r=0.855 (0 being no relation and 1 perfect correlation).(5)
      </p>
      <img src="./img/imagefour.jpg" />
      <p>
        Financial markets had every cause to be concerned, and they reacted
        accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        What caused the decline in profits, however, is misunderstood.
        Simplistically speaking, profits are determined by (1) sales i.e.
        revenues, (2) gross margins, and (3) operating expenses i.e. rent,
        people, capital investments etc, and the relation between the three.
      </p>
      <p><b>1. The sales theory</b></p>
      <p>
        The most common theory is that traditional retailers are worth less
        because they are losing sales – dubbed the “Amazon theory”. In a world
        where dollars are leaving brick-and-mortar for online, traditional
        retailers recapture only part of the dollars on their own websites and
        their total revenues decline. That quickly impacts profits, as costs are
        mostly not adjustable.
      </p>
      <p>
        With two-thirds of the retailers in the dataset shedding both profit and
        market value, one would expect sales levels to have declined too. In
        fact, that was far from the case.
      </p>
      <p>
        Out of 30 retailers, only 7 saw sales decline. Combined sales grew +10%,
        including +6% without discounters. 2019 was a record year of sales for
        Target, Foot Locker, Dick’s, REI, Genesco, Designer Brands (DSW) and
        American Eagle – although half were worth less in 2020 than 2016. Just
        one retailer saw sales decline in the double-digits: JC Penney (-15%).
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, although ecommerce captured 40% of total retail growth in the US
        since 2016(6), part of that growth went to traditional retailers (via
        their websites), and that still left another 60% for brick-and-mortar.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact that market capitalization (ex. Discounters) fell -19% while
        sales grew suggests limited linearity between the two. Examples abound
        where they moved in polar opposite directions. Hibbett Sports, for
        instance, grew revenues +26% but lost -51% of its market value. DSW grew
        +33% but lost -49% of its value. Urban Outfitters (URBN) grew sales +16%
        but lost -18% of its value. Sales and profit, too, show few signs of
        moving hand in hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is not to say sales growth was irrelevant. It seemed to be a
        pre-requisite for market cap growth – no retailer grew the latter
        without the former, and it usually took high sales growth to lift stock
        prices.(7)
      </p>
      <p>
        Sales in isolation, however, do not explain underlying trends in the
        retail industry.
      </p>
      <p><b>2. The Gross Margin theory</b></p>
      <p>
        The second major contributor to profit is gross margins. Gross margins
        depend both on real retail prices i.e. the price of goods at checkout,
        and on the cost of acquiring those goods (COGS). Cost of goods often
        represent more than two-thirds of retailers’ sales, so their role is
        critical.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many legacy retailers, the theory goes, have had to resort to mass
        discounting and promotions to retain customers, hurting real retail
        prices and margins. Simultaneously, consumer goods are still largely
        manufactured overseas – particularly in the Far East – where costs have
        risen fast. Consumer-price inflation at home, meanwhile, has remained
        low.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rising input costs + widespread discounting + a lack of consumer-price
        inflation = a recipe for declining gross margins
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet here too, the data is not convincing. Cost of goods did increase
        over the period, but at +11.6% growth they did not do so much faster
        than sales (+10.2%). As a share of sales, they inched up from 65.8% to
        66.6%.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although manufacturing costs in Asia have increased, retailers and
        brands have also moved production around. Apparel manufacturing moved to
        India and Bangladesh and footwear to Indonesia or Vietnam. Furniture and
        home goods adjusted, too, and beauty products are still largely
        manufactured in the US or Europe, so relatively unaffected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Retailers were also able, perhaps, to pass on rising input costs to
        their suppliers and brands. Either way, gross margin trends are not
        sufficient to explain declining profits.
      </p>
      <p><b>3. Operating expenses</b></p>
      <p>
        That leaves operating expenses – the day-to-day costs required to run a
        retail business, the biggest of which are usually rent, people and
        capital investments. (For highly leveraged retailers, debt servicing can
        be too). Whereas cost of goods represent two-thirds of sales, operating
        expenses – poorly managed – can rise to a third.
      </p>
      <p>
        Financial data shows total retail operating costs grew +17.2% between
        2015-19, comfortably outpacing sales. That saw them rise from 25.2% of
        sales to 26.8%. That may not sound like much, but combined with slightly
        higher COGS, the 1.6 percentage point increase in operating costs was
        enough to wipe out all profit growth over the period, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looked at another way, had operating expenses remained constant at 25.2%
        of sales, profits in 2019 would have been $5.5bn higher than 2015, a
        +18% increase rather than the actual -18% decline. The health of retail,
        today, would be judged very differently.
      </p>
      <img src="./img/imagefive.jpg" />
      <p><b>Balancing today versus tomorrow</b></p>
      <p>
        Outside of earnings calls and analyst reports, operating expenses are
        rarely mentioned in conversations on the state of retail. Yet they will
        likely shape its future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Operating costs are usually combined into one reporting line called
        “selling & general administrative expenses”, so financial reports offer
        an incomplete picture. Nevertheless, several factors likely explain
        their upward trajectory.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, people and rents were probably not the cause. US wage growth
        barely averaged 1.5% a year between 2014-18.(8) The lowest incomes,
        which most retail workers sadly are, grew even less. Additionally, there
        were only 0.6% more workers employed in retail in 2019 than 4 years
        earlier.(9) That does not point to increased people costs. If anything,
        they probably fell as a share of sales as retailers reduced the number
        of salespeople on the shop floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rents, too, were unlikely a contributing factor. Commercial leases have
        barely kept up with inflation. Vacancies are widespread. Retailers are
        closing under-performing stores. Even if sales densities (per square
        foot) have tended to fall, online sales more than make up. The drivers
        of increased operating costs are to be found elsewhere in the business.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reality is that taking stock of the critical juncture at which they
        stand, retailers have started investing heavily for the future – a last
        throw of the dice of sorts. That includes investing in everything from
        overhauling IT systems, omnichannel and digital capability, refitting
        warehouses for ecommerce, and experimenting with alternative business
        models.
      </p>
      <p>
        Increased IT spending in retail is widespread. Cloud sales are booming.
        “Digital transformations” are the bread and butter of management
        consulting firms – as much as 88% of retailers claim to be undertaking
        one.(10) Investments touch everything from people processes to software
        and cloud. For all the talk of AI reshaping the global economy,
        according to McKinsey no industry stands to reap more benefits than
        retail.(11) All of these investments are imperative, but few are
        inexpensive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditional retailers are also experimenting with alternative business
        models. Nordstrom acquired subscription service Trunk Club for $350m in
        2016 (equivalent to their entire profit that year); Foot Locker invested
        $100m in sneaker-reselling app GOAT last year (20% of profits); rental
        services and second-hand resale platforms are proliferating. Not all
        will pay off, but attempts are being made.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, capital expenditures are being driven by brick-and-mortar
        itself, through renovation and innovation. New flagships and concept
        stores are opening regularly. Nordstrom opened its first New York City
        flagship last year. Foot Locker, Kohl’s, Dick’s, Crate & Barrel all
        recently unveiled new concept store formats. DSW has installed nail
        salons in many stores. Nearly every major retailer is experimenting,
        looking for the store of the future, and embracing the new “retail as
        theatre” mantra.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are just a few of the extensive, expensive and belated investments
        retailers are making. Short-term profits, then, were sacrificed in favor
        of a better shot at long-term survival.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current share of sales generated online is probably a good indicator
        of who the future winners and losers are likely to be. Sadly, that
        metric is rarely disclosed (in itself a telling sign). Some retailers
        will successfully reinvent themselves and emerge as new, future-ready
        entities. Many will not be so fortunate. The stock market has continued
        to value retailers largely on their reported profits. It may yet have to
        refine its criteria.
      </p>
      <p><b>Not all retailers were created equal</b></p>
      <p>
        Amid all this, it is easy to forget significant variance exists within
        brick-and-mortar retail. Performances were uneven. Ulta Beauty and its
        +89% sales growth was in few ways alike to Kohl’s, despite the two often
        standing side by side in strip malls.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this context, it is worth examining several other theories on the
        decline of brick-and-mortar:
      </p>
      <p>- Stores are too big and big-box models outdated</p>
      <p>- Retailers have too many stores</p>
      <p>- Retailers sell too many different categories</p>
      <p><b>1. Size of stores</b></p>
      <p>
        Our dataset shows no clear relation between a retailer’s performance and
        the size of their stores.(12) Some retailers performed well despite
        operating big-box formats, including Restauration Hardware and Dicks,
        who grew sales +26% and +20% respectively. Discount retailers, too,
        outperformed despite operating relatively large stores. Home Depot and
        Lowe’s are further illustration that large stores can work.
      </p>
      <p>Size does not seem to matter.</p>
      <p><b>2. Too many stores</b></p>
      <p>
        A second argument suggests retailers are stretched across too many
        locations, with too many in unprofitable markets. That, too, does not
        stand up to scrutiny. There is no apparent (negative) correlation
        between number of stores and sales or profit growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides retailers like TJX and Ross, who have some of the widest store
        bases in the country, Ulta Beauty and Target both show a retailer can
        have 1,800+ stores in the US and still thrive. As retail executives
        attest, some of the smallest markets are sometimes home to the most
        profitable stores.
      </p>
      <img src="./img/imagesix.jpg" />
      <p><b>3. Jack of all trades, master of none</b></p>
      <p>This argument is perhaps the most compelling.</p>
      <p>
        The consumer goods in this report were broken down into 15
        sub-categories:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Leather goods & watches 2. Casual & formal apparel 3. Athletic
        apparel 4. Casual & formal footwear 5. Athletic footwear 6. Kids apparel
        & footwear 7. Sporting goods 8. Beauty 9. Bed & bath 10. Furniture 11.
        Jewelry 12. Toys & baby product 13. Electronics 14. Hardware 15. Pet
        supplies
      </p>
      <p>
        Tallying the number offered by each retailer in their stores(13) shows
        it to be one of the most accurate predictors of a retailer’s sales
        performance: the more categories, the less retailers were able to
        generate growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Retailers that sold 4 or fewer categories (two-thirds of surveyed
        retailers) grew sales +27% and kept profits flat. Those that sold 5+
        categories failed to grow sales at all and saw profits collapse -34%.
      </p>
      <p>
        16 retailers grew sales double digits – only Urban Outfitters managed to
        do so with more than 4 categories (+18% sales with 8 categories)(14) .
        Conversely, 5 of the 7 retailers who saw sales decline offered more than
        6 categories in stores. Overall, the relation holds whether discounters
        are included or not.(15)
      </p>
      <img src="./img/imageseven.jpg" />
      <p>
        Department stores – who tend to offer between 10 and 14 categories –
        were among the worst performers. Their lack of focus has seen them
        become over-inventoried, over-categorized and increasingly unable to
        attract customers. However, the relationship holds regardless of whether
        or not department stores are included.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where one-stop-shops were once prized by consumers for their
        convenience, in a world where infinite choice exists online,
        brick-and-mortar must offer something different to customers. At that
        game, the specialists have shown to be more adept.
      </p>
      <img src="./img/imageeight.jpg" />
      <p><b>Into the future </b></p>
      <p>
        Beneath all the data, trends from the last few years offer a glimpse
        into the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        The retailers most likely to make the transition to Retail 2.0 will be
        neither big nor small. Stores will continue to come in all sizes. For
        every small, urban store, there will be a successful big-box chain. Some
        retailers will continue to thrive with 2,000+ stores nationwide. Others
        will find success only in razor-like focus on 120 key markets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brick-and-mortar retailers, however, will have to become not just
        proficient omni-channel operators, but also more specialized, focusing
        on a narrow assortment of product and building compelling experiences
        around them. The generalist one-stop-shop role will be left to
        ecommerce.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where that leaves department stores remains to be seen, but the writings
        on the wall are not reassuring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, discounters have emerged as formidable retailers, built on a
        narrow strategy of selling cheap branded wares from previous seasons.
        That they rely on the stock mismanagement of others to acquire product
        is unlikely to become a liability anytime soon. Their lack of digital
        capability, however, may. Only time will tell if they deserve their
        newly lofty valuations.
      </p>
      <p><b>Final thoughts</b></p>
      <p>
        Industries generally respond to structural shocks by consolidating. That
        happens in two ways – through mergers or acquisitions, or when weaker
        players disappear.
      </p>
      <p>
        There have been shy signs of retail M&A in the US, mostly among smaller
        chains: Hibbett & City Gear, DTLR & Villa, JD Sports & Finish Line,
        Snipes & Kicks USA, Mr. Alan’s, among others. Authentic Brands with its
        Aeropostale, Forever 21 and Lucky Brand acquisitions is one large player
        experimenting. Rising capital expenditures will continue to make
        consolidation appealing. Still, M&A activity has been underwhelming
        relative to the shock facing the industry – the unwanted baggage of
        acquiring a competitor’s stores leases weighs heavily on the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        That leaves the bankruptcy route. The 2020 pandemic accelerated many
        casualties, most recently JC Penney and Neiman Marcus. The data suggests
        more are on the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the long run, however, retailers that successfully innovate, invest,
        embed technology and transition to the new retail age stand to gain
        everything. According to research(16) , the store of the future is
        projected to be twice as profitable as its equivalent today. That would
        put the retail industry back on its pedestal of yesteryear. Some
        retailers may yet be worth doubling down on.
